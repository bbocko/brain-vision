# Brain Vision

Brain Vision is a face recognition app that uses the Clarifai API to detect faces in images. 

It features a simple user interface that allows users to input an image URL, which is then passed through a function that makes a request to the Clarifai API to detect any faces in the image. The app displays the image with bounding boxes around any detected faces.
